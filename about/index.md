# About S_TIDE

S\_TIDE is developed by [Dr. Haidong Pan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haidong-Pan) based on [T\_Tide](https://www-old.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/). S\_TIDE is still being continuously updated, with the goal of making it an all-in-one toolbox for tidal data. Namely, I wish that everything about tides can be handled via S\_TIDE. 

S\_TIDE toolbox also contains a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which can perform harmonic analysis, predict tides and calculate riding tidal levels. This GUI is designed for users who are not familiar with MATLAB programming.
