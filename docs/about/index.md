# About S_TIDE

S\_TIDE is developed by Dr. Haidong Pan (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haidong-Pan) based on T\_Tide. S\_TIDE is still being continuously updated, with the goal of making it an all-in-one toolbox for tidal data. Namely, I wish that everything about tides can be handled via S\_TIDE. Users can download the latest S\_TIDE toolbox from:** **[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369066450\_S\_TIDE\_toolbox](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369066450_S_TIDE_toolbox)

S\_TIDE toolbox also contains a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which can perform harmonic analysis, predict tides and calculate riding tidal levels. This GUI is designed for users who are not familiar with MATLAB programming. Please refer Pan et al., (2018) if you use S\_TIDE in your paper! If you have any questions, just send emails to me (panhaidong@fio.ogr.cn, panhaidong\_phd@qq.com).
