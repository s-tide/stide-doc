s\_tide\_m8.m - a modified version of s\_tide\_m3.m (only uses nodal factor and angle at central time for nodal correction)

Notes: s\_tide series functions use independent point (IP) scheme to obtain temporal variability of tidal parameters. For classical harmonic analysis, IP number should be set as 1, namely, tidal parameters are time-invariant. If IP number is set to 2, linear variations of tidal parameters can be obtained. The increase of IP number can induce more complicated variability in tidal parameters, but also increases the risk of over-fitting. For even tide gauge data, users can use s\_tide\_m8 function. For even/uneven satellite data, users can use s\_tide\_m4/s\_tide\_m6 function. For tidal current data, users need to analyze u and v respectively, and put tidal constants of u and v into s\_estimate\_tidal\_ellipse function to calculate tidal ellipse parameters.
